# Exam-4
Files for Exam 4

For this exam I'm going to throw in what I have. 

The test.py contains the scripts I as able to piece together. These are the possible Kmer, observed Kmer, and linguistic complexity functions. I was unable to get anything ellse to run. 

Tests worked sparodically, not sure if its my terminal, a forgotten step, or the usual coding demons.
